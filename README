PhotoBooth Service
==================

Proof of Concept service that watches the ~/Pictures/Photo Booth/ directory 
on Mac OS X for new *.jpg images.  Your JavaScript code is called immediately 
if there is an image in that directory and then called whenever a newer image 
is detected.  BrowserPlus is required.

This service is not production quality.  It is meant as a proof-of-concept/hack 
to explore web user interfaces and see how much easier it would be for users if 
they did not have to explicitly Browser/Upload a file (or even Drag+Drop with 
BrowserPlus).  Code like this could be used to offer an easy way for users to 
take a profile photo, crop it, add effects and upload it in a much simplified 
work flow.  

TBD ... Have cropping and special effects in the demo.
